# Design, Provision and Monitor AWS Infrastructure at Scale

- In this project, I planned, designed, provisioned, and monitored infrastructure in AWS using industry-standard and open source tools.

- I also practiced my newly acquired skills of optimizing infrastructure for cost and performance.

- Finally, I used Terraform to provision and configure AWS services in a global configuration.
